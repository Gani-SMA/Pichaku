# Message Deletion Fix

## Issue

Users were unable to delete messages in the chat interface.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Welcome Message Issue

- The welcome message had a hardcoded ID ("welcome") that doesn't exist in the database
- Attempting to delete it would fail silently
- **Fix:** Disabled edit/delete for the welcome message

### 2. Error Handling

- Delete function didn't provide clear error messages
- No validation to check if the message actually belonged to the user's conversation
- **Fix:** Enhanced error handling with specific error messages

## Changes Made

### File: `src/hooks/useMessages.ts`

**Enhanced `deleteMessage` function:**

- Added conversation ID validation
- Added `.select()` to verify the delete operation succeeded
- Added check to ensure message exists and user has permission
- Improved error messages with specific details
- Better error logging for debugging

### File: `src/pages/Chat.tsx`

**Prevented deletion of welcome message:**

- Added check: `message.id !== "welcome"` for both `canEdit` and `canDelete`
- Welcome message now cannot be edited or deleted

## How It Works Now

1. **User clicks delete button** on their own message
2. **Confirmation dialog** appears (already implemented)
3. **Delete function** soft-deletes the message by setting `deleted_at` timestamp
4. **Verification** checks that the operation succeeded
5. **Local state** updates to remove the message from UI
6. **Success toast** confirms deletion

## Database Schema

Messages use **soft delete** pattern:

- `deleted_at` column stores deletion timestamp
- Deleted messages are filtered out in queries: `.is("deleted_at", null)`
- Allows for data recovery if needed
- Automatic cleanup after 90 days (retention policy)

## RLS Policies

Row Level Security ensures users can only delete their own messages:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own messages"
ON public.messages
FOR UPDATE
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM conversations
    WHERE conversations.id = messages.conversation_id
    AND conversations.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] User can delete their own messages
- [x] User cannot delete AI assistant messages
- [x] User cannot delete welcome message
- [x] Deleted messages disappear from UI immediately
- [x] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [x] Database is updated correctly (soft delete)
- [x] RLS policies prevent unauthorized deletions

## Error Messages

### Success

- "Message deleted successfully."

### Errors

- "No active conversation found." - When conversationId is null
- "Message not found or you don't have permission to delete it." - When message doesn't exist or user lacks permission
- "Failed to delete message. Please try again." - Generic error fallback

## Future Enhancements

1. **Undo Delete** - Add ability to restore recently deleted messages
2. **Bulk Delete** - Allow deleting multiple messages at once
3. **Delete Conversation** - Add option to delete entire conversation
4. **Archive** - Alternative to delete for important conversations
