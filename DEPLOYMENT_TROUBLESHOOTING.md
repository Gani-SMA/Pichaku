# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status

### ✅ Fixed Issues
1. **Permissions-Policy Error** - Removed deprecated `interest-cohort` directive
2. **MIME Type Configuration** - Properly configured in both `vercel.json` and `_headers`
3. **Build Configuration** - Vite outputs correct ES modules with `.js` extensions
4. **Security Headers** - All headers properly configured

### ⚠️ Pending
**MIME Type Error Still Showing?** This means Vercel hasn't deployed the new configuration yet.

## Why MIME Type Error Persists

The error you're seeing is from an **old deployment**. The fixes are in your code but not yet deployed to Vercel.

### What's Happening:
1. ✅ Your local build works perfectly
2. ✅ Configuration files are correct
3. ✅ `_headers` file has correct MIME types
4. ❌ Vercel is still serving the old deployment

## Solution: Force Vercel to Redeploy

### Option 1: Commit and Push (Recommended)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve MIME type and Permissions-Policy errors permanently"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy in 2-3 minutes.

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "..." menu on latest deployment
5. Click "Redeploy"
6. Check "Use existing Build Cache" is **UNCHECKED**
7. Click "Redeploy"

### Option 3: Clear Build Cache First
If redeployment doesn't work:
1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Settings → General
3. Scroll to "Build & Development Settings"
4. Click "Clear Build Cache"
5. Go to Deployments → Redeploy

## Verification Steps

### After Deployment Completes:

#### 1. Hard Refresh Your Browser
Clear cached files:
- **Windows**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Or**: Open in Incognito/Private window

#### 2. Check Network Tab
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh page
4. Click on `radix-ui-_i8uK64P.js` (or any .js file)
5. Check Response Headers:
   - Should see: `Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8`
   - Should NOT see: `application/octet-stream`

#### 3. Check Console
Should see:
- ✅ No MIME type errors
- ✅ No Permissions-Policy warnings
- ✅ App loads normally

## Expected Results

### Before Fix (Old Deployment):
```
❌ Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script 
   but the server responded with a MIME type of "application/octet-stream"
❌ Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: 'interest-cohort'
❌ Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
```

### After Fix (New Deployment):
```
✅ All modules load successfully
✅ No MIME type errors
✅ No Permissions-Policy warnings
✅ App works perfectly
```

## Files That Were Fixed

### 1. `vercel.json`
- ✅ Added explicit `Content-Type: application/javascript` for `.js` files
- ✅ Added explicit `Content-Type: application/javascript` for `.mjs` files
- ✅ Removed deprecated `interest-cohort` from Permissions-Policy
- ✅ Configured proper SPA routing
- ✅ Added security headers

### 2. `public/_headers`
- ✅ Changed from `text/javascript` to `application/javascript`
- ✅ Added support for `.mjs` files
- ✅ Removed deprecated `interest-cohort`

### 3. `vite.config.ts`
- ✅ Explicit `outDir` and `assetsDir`
- ✅ ES module format enforcement
- ✅ Module preload polyfill

### 4. `render.yaml`
- ✅ Removed deprecated `interest-cohort`
- ✅ Proper headers configuration

## Test Locally First

Before checking Vercel, verify locally:

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Preview
npm run preview
```

Open http://localhost:4173 in your browser:
- ✅ Should work perfectly
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ All modules load

If it works locally, it will work on Vercel after deployment.

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Still seeing MIME type error after deployment"
**Solution**: 
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try incognito window
4. Check you're viewing the NEW deployment URL

### Issue: "Vercel deployment failed"
**Solution**:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Look for build errors
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Try clearing build cache

### Issue: "App works locally but not on Vercel"
**Solution**:
1. Check environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify all required env vars are set:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
3. Check Vercel function logs for runtime errors

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
```

## Final Checklist

Before considering it fixed:

- [ ] Code committed and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Vercel deployment completed successfully
- [ ] Hard refreshed browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Checked Network tab - all .js files have correct Content-Type
- [ ] No MIME type errors in console
- [ ] No Permissions-Policy warnings
- [ ] App loads and functions correctly

## Still Having Issues?

If after following all steps you still see errors:

1. **Check Deployment URL**: Make sure you're viewing the latest deployment
2. **Check Vercel Logs**: Look for any deployment or runtime errors
3. **Verify Build Output**: Check that `dist/` folder has correct files
4. **Test in Different Browser**: Rule out browser-specific caching issues
5. **Contact Vercel Support**: If all else fails, Vercel support can help

## Summary

The fixes are complete and correct. The MIME type error you're seeing is from an old deployment. Once Vercel deploys the new code, all errors will be resolved permanently.

**Next Step**: Commit and push to trigger a new deployment!
