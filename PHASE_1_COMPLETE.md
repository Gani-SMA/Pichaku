## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Created:

1. `src/utils/responseValidator.ts` (150 lines)
2. `src/utils/complexityDetector.ts` (200 lines)

### Files Modified:

1. `supabase/functions/legal-chat/index.ts` - Enhanced system prompt
2. `src/pages/Chat.tsx` - Integrated validation and complexity detection

### Integration Points:

**In Chat Component**:

```typescript
// 1. Analyze complexity on user input
const complexityAnalysis = analyzeComplexity(sanitizedContent);

// 2. Show emergency warning if detected
if (isEmergency(complexityAnalysis)) {
  toast({ title: "🚨 Emergency Detected", ... });
}

// 3. Validate AI response
const validation = validateResponse(assistantContent);
logValidation(conversationId, validation);

// 4. Add lawyer recommendation if complex
const lawyerRec = getLawyerRecommendation(complexityAnalysis);
const finalContent = lawyerRec ? assistantContent + lawyerRec : assistantContent;

// 5. Show quality warning if needed
if (!validation.isValid && needsRegeneration(validation)) {
  toast({ title: "Response Quality Notice", ... });
}
```
